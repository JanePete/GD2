    <h1>Yes, the Octopus Is Smart as Heck. But Why?</h1>

    <h2>It has eight arms, three hearts — and a plan. Scientists aren’t sure how the cephalopods got to be so
        intelligent.</h2>

            An octopus in an aquarium in Brest, France. The animals are highly intelligent, but researchers are
            uncertain how the trait evolved.</figcaption>

    </figure>

    <p> To demonstrate how smart an octopus can be, Piero Amodio points to a YouTube video. It shows an octopus
        pulling
        two halves of a coconut shell together to hide inside. Later the animal stacks the shells together like
        nesting
        bowls — and carts them away.</p>

    <blockquote>“The octopus is carrying these tools around because it has some understanding they may be useful in
        the
        future,” said Mr. Amodio</blockquote>

    <p>But his amazement is mixed with puzzlement.</p>

    <p>For decades, researchers have studied how certain animals evolved to be intelligent, among them apes,
        elephants,
        dolphins and even some birds, such as crows and parrots.</p>

    <p>But all the scientific theories fail when it comes to cephalopods, a group that includes octopuses, squid
        and
        cuttlefish. Despite feats of creativity, they
        <a href=<cite>lack some hallmarks</cite></a>
        of intelligence seen in other species.

        <p>“It’s an apparent paradox that’s been largely overlooked in the past,” said Mr. Amodio. He and five
            other
            experts on animal intelligence explore this paradox in a paper published this month in the journal
            Trends
            in Ecology and Evolution.</p>

        <p>For scientists who study animal behavior, intelligence is not about acing a calculus test or taking a
            car
            apart and putting it back together. Intelligence comprises sophisticated cognitive skills that help an
            animal thrive.</p>

        <p>That may include the ability to come up with solutions to the problem of finding food, for example, or
            aknack for planning for some challenge in the future. Intelligent animals don’t rely on fixed
            responsesto
            survive — they can invent new behaviors on the fly.</p>

        <p>To measure animal intelligence, scientists observe creatures in the wild — watching a dolphin stick
            a sponge on its beak to avoid getting cuts from sharp they bring animals into the lab
            and
            offer them puzzles to solve, such as rewarding crows when they <a href=<cite>learn to rip paper into
                strips
                of just the right size.</cite></a></p>

        <p>Only a few species stand out in these studies, and by comparing them, scientists have identified
            someshared
            factors. The animals have big brains relative to their body size, they live for a long time, andthey
            can
            form long-lasting social bonds.</p>
