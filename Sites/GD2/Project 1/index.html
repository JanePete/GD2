    <h1>Yes, the Octopus Is Smart as Heck. But Why?</h1>

    <h2>It has eight arms, three hearts — and a plan. Scientists aren’t sure how the cephalopods got to be so
        intelligent.</h2>

        <p>To demonstrate how smart an octopus can be, Piero Amodio points to a YouTube video. It shows an octopus
            pulling two halves of a coconut shell together to hide inside. Later the animal stacks the shells together
            like nesting bowls — and carts them away.
            <p />

            <p>“It suggests the octopus is carrying these tools around because it has some understanding they may be
                useful in the future,” said Mr. Amodio, a graduate student studying animal intelligence at the
                University of Cambridge in Britain.</p>

            <p>But his amazement is mixed with puzzlement.</p>

            <p>For decades, researchers have studied how certain animals evolved to be intelligent, among them apes,
                elephants, dolphins and even some birds, such as crows and parrots.</p>

            <p>But all the scientific theories fail when it comes to cephalopods, a group that includes octopuses,
                squid and cuttlefish. Despite feats of creativity, they <a href=<cite>lack some hallmarks</cite></a> of
                intelligence seen in other species.</p>

            <p>“It’s an apparent paradox that’s been largely overlooked in the past,” said Mr. Amodio. He and five
                other experts on animal intelligence explore this paradox in a paper published this month in the
                journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution.</p>

            <p>For scientists who study animal behavior, intelligence is not about acing a calculus test or taking a
                car apart and putting it back together. Intelligence comprises sophisticated cognitive skills that help
                an animal thrive.</p>

            <p>That may include the ability to come up with solutions to the problem of finding food, for example, or a
                knack for planning for some challenge in the future. Intelligent animals don’t rely on fixed responses
                to survive — they can invent new behaviors on the fly.</p>

            <p>To measure animal intelligence, scientists observe creatures in the wild — watching a dolphin <a href=<cite>stick
                    a sponge on its beak to avoid getting cuts</cite></a> from sharp rocks and coral, for example. Or
                they bring animals into the lab and offer them puzzles to solve, such as rewarding crows when they <a
                    href=<cite>learn to rip paper into strips of just the right size.</cite></a></p>

            <p>Only a few species stand out in these studies, and by comparing them, scientists have identified some
                shared factors. The animals have big brains relative to their body size, they live for a long time, and
                they can form long-lasting social bonds.</p>
