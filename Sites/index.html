        <h1>A Day in Chicago</h1>

        <h2> Hour 1 10:15 </h2>
        <img scr=<p> This photo is from a sunny chicago morning on Thursday, March 1st. On the way to breakfast, we
        stopped to admire the city's amazing arcitexture.

        <h2> Hour 2 11:05 </h2>
        <img src=< p> Pictured from left to right is my twin sister Jenny, and my two roomates, Dasha and Damla.
        Together, we explored Chicago. Jenny goes to school in the city and knew all the best spots! Here they are
        pictured in front of the lake that was just dyed green for St. Patricks Day.

        <h2> Hour 3 12:30 </h2>
        <img src=<p> Breakfast time! At noon we stopped by Stan's Donuts, a local chain, to grab donuts and coffee.

        <h2> Hour 4 1:30 </h2>
        <img src=<p> A classic bean pic! Althogh we were with a local, we had to do all the cheesy tourist activities
        too! Here is a pic of all of us in the reflection of The Bean, a sculpture in Millenial Park. Fun fact: the
        bean is just a nickname or the real sculpture title, "Cloud Gate" after the way it reflects the sky. </p>

        <h2> Hour 5 2:00 </h2>
        <img src=<p> In the afternoon we walked the Magnificant Mile and did some window shopping.

        <h2> Hour 6 3:45 </h2>
        <img src=<p> Mid-day, we rented bicycles and rode by the Navy Pier which features a beautiful view of the
        skyline and Lake Michigan.

        <h2> Hour 7 4:20 </h2>
        <img src=<p> As a snack, we stopped by a foodtruck to get cheese fries and Chicago-style hotdog! </p>

        <h2> Hour 8 5:30 </h2>
        <img src=<p> We took the pinkline on the L to a neighboorhood called Pilson for some thrifting. In this photo,
        someone had wrote "old werld" in the dust on a store window.</p>

        <h2> Hour 9 6:45 </h2>
        <img src=<p> Nearby, we stopped into a bookstore. There were techinically no phones allowed for some reason but
        I was feling rebellious so this is a snapshot I took of the mystery section! </p>

        <h2> Hour 10 7:30 </h2>
        <img src=<p> Outside another bookstore! We love to browse! </p>

        <h2> Hour 11 8:45 </h2>
        <img src=<p> Late dinner at Dough Bro's pizza! It was hard to find thin crust pizza in Chicago but finally we
        satisfied our East Coast cravings! </p>


        <h2> Hour 12 8:00 </h2>
        <img src=<p> At the James M. Nederlander Theatre, we saw "A Bronx Tale" the musical. Less well known but still
        a great soundtrack.</p>

        <h2> Hour 13 9:45 </h2>

        <p> Torwards the end of the night, the weather got a lot colder and the sky a lot foggier. This is a picture of
            the Skyskrapers as we walked around at night. </p>

        <h2> Hour 14 10:00 </h2>

        <p> This is another image where I tried to capture the buildings fading into the fog. A gloomy end to a sunny
            day. </p>
