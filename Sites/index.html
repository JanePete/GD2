            <h3> Hour 1 [ 10:15 ] </h3>
            <img src="img/Hour-1.jpg" alt="Picture looking up at the above-ground train and skyscrapers">
            <figcaption> This photo is from a sunny chicago morning on Thursday, March 1st. On the way to breakfast, we
                stopped to admire the city's amazing arcitecture.</figcaption>

            <h3> Hour 2 11:05 </h3>
            <img src="img/Hour-2.jpg" alt="3 girls pictured on a bridge">
            <figcaption> Pictured from left to right is my twin
                sister Jenny, and my two roomates, Dasha
                and Damla.
                Together, we explored Chicago. Jenny goes to school in the city and knew all the best spots! Here
                they are
                pictured in front of the lake that was just dyed green for St. Patricks Day.</figcaption>

            <h3> Hour 3 12:30 </h3>
            <img src="img/Hour-3.jpg" alt="Selfie of two girls holding donuts">
            <figcaption> Breakfast time! At noon we stopped
                by Stan's Donuts, a local chain, to grab
                donuts and coffee. I ate a pistachio donut-much better than expected!</figcaption>

            <h3> Hour 4 1:30 </h3>
            <img src="img/Hour-4.jpg" alt="Picture of a reflection of a group of girls in a crowd">
            <figcaption> A classic bean
                pic! Although we were with a local, we had to do all the cheesy tourist activities too! Here
                is a pic of
                all of us in the reflection of The Bean, a sculpture in Millenial Park. Fun fact: the bean
                is just a
                nickname or the real sculpture title, "Cloud Gate" after the way it reflects the sky.</figcaption>

            <h3> Hour 5 2:00 </h3>
            <img src="img/Hour-5.jpg" alt="2 girls under a street sign titled 'Magnificent Mile'">
            <figcaption> In the afternoon
                we walked the Magnificant Mile and did some window shopping. Because we couldn't bring any
                liquids on the
                plane, everymorning we stopped by the Macy's perfume counter and just laid it on thick! The
                ladies there
                started getting really annoyed by the end of the week...</figcaption>

            <h3> Hour 6 3:45 </h3>
            <img src="img/Hour-6.jpg" alt="two girls on bicycles with city skyline in the back">
            <figcaption> Mid-day, we rented
                bicycles and rode by the Navy Pier which features a beautiful
                view of the skyline and Lake Michigan. I tried to take pictures while riding my bike and
                I literally fell
                off. There is also no railing between the sidewalk and Lake Michigan! A very dangerous
                situation for
                uncoordinated people like myself.</figcaption>

            <h3> Hour 7 4:20 </h3>
            <img src="img/Hour-7.jpg" alt="selfie of three girls holding a basket of fries and a hotdog">
            <figcaption> As a
                snack, we stopped by a foodtruck to get cheese fries and a Chicago-style
                hotdog! T'was delicious.</figcaption>

            <h3> Hour 8 5:30 </h3>
            <img src="img/Hour-8.jpg" alt="picture of a window with words written in it's dust">
            <figcaption> We took the
                pinkline on the L to a neighboorhood called Pilson for some
                thrift and vintage shoppping. In this photo, someone had wrote "old werld" in the
                dust on a store window.</figcaption>

            <h3> Hour 9 6:45 </h3>
            <img src="img/Hour-9.jpg" alt="picture of the corner of a library bookshelf">
            <figcaption> Nearby, we stopped into a
                bookstore. There were techinically no phones allowed
                for some reason but I was feling rebellious so this is a snapshot I took of the
                mystery section! ;) </figcaption>

                pizza! It was hard to find thin crust pizza in
                Chicago but finally we satisfied our East Coast cravings! </figcaption>


            <h3> Hour 12 8:00 </h3>
            <img src="img/Hour-12.jpg" alt="image of the James M. Netherlander Theatre stage">
            <figcaption>At the James M. Nederlander Theatre, we saw "A Bronx Tale"
                the musical. Less
                well known but nevertheless a great soundtrack.
            </figcaption>

            <h3> Hour 13 9:45 </h3>
            <img src="img/Hour-13.jpg" alt="Image of the Chicago Riverwalk sign in front of two buildings">
            <figcaption> Torwards
                the end of the night, the weather got a lot colder and the sky a lot foggier. This is a
                picture of
                the Skyskrapers as we walked around at night. </figcaption>

            <img src="img/Hour-14.jpg" alt="image of skyscrapers at night">
            <figcaption> This is another image where I tried to
                capture the buildings fading into the
                fog. A gloomy end to a sunny day. </figcaption>
